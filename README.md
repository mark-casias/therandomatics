Built on SvelteKit

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've downloaded the project and installed dependencies with `yarn install`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
